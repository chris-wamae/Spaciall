This is an application for calculating perimter, area and volume of regaular shapes.
It is built using c-sharp on the .NET framwork and is  a console application.

## Features
1. Calculating perimeter 
2. Calculating area
3. Calculating volume
4. Predicting calculation
5. Predicting the shape

## Shapes
Circle, Square, Rectangle, Trapezium, Triangle

## Solids
Sphere, Cube, Cuboid, Trapezoidal prism, Cyclinder,Square Pyramid,Triangular pyramid

## Measurements
The standard measurement is metres. The application can also return the result in Centimetres or Kilometres.

## Application usage
On starting the application, a user is greeted with a welcome message.
The are then prompted to Enter the name of the shape they would like to do a calculation for. After this, they are asked to name the type of calculation they would like to do.Finally, they are asked what unit they would like their result displayed in The app then calculates the anwser and displays it to the user.
A user can fail to provide the name of the figure or the type of calculation they want but they cannot fail to provide atleast one measure of length. When the user doesnt select a name or type of calculation, the application does all possible calculations possible with the given measurements and returns the perimeter, area and volume if possible.
